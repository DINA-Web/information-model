The following are RECOMMENDED guidelines for QA (quality assurance) of DINA-Web modules.

# Summary

Manual checks:

  - Check that sources are available openly under acceptable license - take a note of GitHub (or equiv.) URL
  - Check that repo shows Green badge for building with Travis CI
  - Check that semantic versioning used - take a note of the version nr
  - Check that Tests are OK
  - Check that Vignette / Turorial / README.md - documentation is provided that explains the module and its usage - take a note of the URL
  - Check that API documentation exists if the module exposes an API - take a note of the URL

Checks using tools:
  
  - Determine Accessibility Guidelines compliance by running tools and looking at results
  - Determine Security OWASP compliance by running tools and looking at results
  - Determine performance/scalability compliance by running load testing tools

# Pass or Fail actions
  
If checks fail, provide results to the module maintainer and kindly ask for specific issues to be fixed. Register issues on relevant repo along with discovered details.

If checks pass then Announce the release passing QA checks to the mailing list and bundle it into integration projects.

FOSS Tools

  - jmeter
  - selenium - http://docs.seleniumhq.org/ with the IDE plugin for browsers: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/ which allows recording a session and then https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/RSelenium.pdf which allows running such a session repeatedly
  - ab - the apache webserver benchmarking tool - sudo apt-get install apache2-utils - example usage at http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-performance-benchmarks-a-web-server.html
  - httping - simple and nice way to ping an http endpoint, see also http://linux.die.net/man/1/httping and https://github.com/sckott/httping
  - siege - http regression testing and benchmarking utility, can do multiple concurrent users, puts your app "under siege"
  - pylot - alternative JMeter but implemented in Python... CLI tool with GUI, also whole framework available: https://github.com/cgoldberg/multi-mechanize
  - httpperf - linux CLI-tool to measure performance under load, docs, manual at http://www.labs.hpe.com/research/linux/httperf/wisp98/httperf.pdf
