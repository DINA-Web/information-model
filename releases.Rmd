The following are RECOMMENDED guidelines to follow when making releases of modules that are used within the DINA-Web system.

# Summary

  - Use Travis CI for build and deploy releases to GitHub Releases
  - Make your README.md contain a "badge" - builds should show green badge :)
  - Use semantic versioning and tag your releases like this: `git tag -a -v0.0.1 -m "description"`
  - Provide a NEWS.md or CHANGELOG for the releases
  - Notify someone at DINA TC if your stable release is ready to go upstream

# Details and rationale

Here follow detailed instructions and explanations of the release guidelines summarized just above. 

## Use semantic versioning

Use semantic versioning used like this in your releases:

  * Increment patch, e.g. 0.8.2 for a patch: you’ve fixed bugs without adding any significant new features. Most releases will have a patch number of 0.

  * Increment minor, e.g. 0.9.0, for a minor release. A minor release can include bug fixes, new features and changes in backward compatibility. This is the most common type of release. 
  
  * Increment major, e.g. 1.0.0, for a major release. This is best reserved for changes that are not backward compatible and that are likely to affect many users. Going from 0.b.c to 1.0.0 typically indicates that your module is feature complete with a stable API.

## Provide README.md and NEWS.md or CHANGELOG.md

Besides a `LICENSE` complying with the DINA-Web Licensing Guidelines (ie AGPL or GPLv3, MIT or Apache for code, Creative Commons for content), please provide a README.md file with a "badge" that indicates that the repo builds successfully. 

Also provide a `NEWS.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` which describes shortly your versioned releases. On GitHub, you can put in your markdown a link that looks like this that allows people to see which changes were made between two releases: `https://github.com/jmenglund/CollectionBatchTool/compare/v0.1.2...v0.1.3`

## Use Travis CI

Use Travis CI both for building and for releasing. A couple of repos have already started this practice, so you can inspect how these modules have chosen to do this:

  - [Collections Management User Interface](https://github.com/DINA-Web/collections-ui)
  - [Media Server API](https://github.com/DINA-Web/mediaserver-module)
  - [DINA-Specify REST API v0](https://github.com/idali0226/dina-web)
  - [CLI-ETL-tool for Collections data](https://github.com/jmenglund/CollectionBatchTool)

### Builds

Use Travis CI to set up builds for the component(s) by adding a simple text file called  `.travis.yml` file to the root directory of your code repository. Guides are available for your stack here:

  - [Java](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java)
  - [Python](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python)
  - [R](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r)
  - [JS](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs)

### Releases

Set up deploy to  GitHub Releases to happen when you push versioned tags. You can find deployment procedures documented here: 

  - [GitHub Releases Guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases)


# Upstream packaging

Released modules that passed the QA check will be packaged upstream into higher level packages which integrate several different modules into a coherent system.

## Use `docker` and `docker-compose` for integration projects

For higher level packaging which integrate released modules into systems, primarily `docker` should be used. 

When docker images of systems are being built, these will call out to "GitHub Releases" to include a specific version of a stable module.

Integration projects should be available as repos at GitHub. Naming of integration projects should follow the current practice of prefigating with "dw-".

Before including stable modules into an upstream package, the DINA TC will need to test and assure the quality of the module. The current state of the union can be seen here: [DINA-Web Blog](http://blog.dina-web.net/progress/)

## Notify DINA TC of your release

For the module to be included into the bigger DINA-Web system, you need to notify DINA TC people that you have a stable build. The DINA TC people will need the repo name, the version number (semantic versioning) and see a "green badge" that the code builds properly using Travis CI.

If the released module checks out well it will be included in the DINA-Web system. 

## Passing the QA checks

The DINA TC  will then run the check. The module will be checked for:

  - Sources are available openly
  - Green badge for building with Travis CI
  - Semantic versioning used
  - Tests are OK
  - Documentation provided that explains the module and its usage
  - API documentation if the module exposes an API
  - Accessibility Guidelines compliance
  - Security OWASP compliance

# Regarding versioning and backward compatibility

The big difference between major and minor versions is whether or not the code is backward compatible. This difference is often academic. In practice, backward compatibility is not an all-or-nothing threshold. 

For example, if you make an API-incompatible change to a rarely-used part of your code, it may not deserve a major number change. But if you fix a bug that many people depend on, it will feel like an API breaking change. Use your best judgement.

The importance of backward compatibility is directly proportional to the number of people using your package: you are trading your time for your users time. The harder you strive to maintain backward compatibility, the harder it is to develop new features or fix old mistakes. 
Backward compatible code also tends to be harder to read because of the need to maintain multiple paths to support functionality from previous versions. Be concerned about backward compatibility, but don’t let it paralyse you.

There are good reasons to make backward incompatible changes - if you made a design mistake that makes your package harder to use it is better to fix it sooner rather than later. If you do need to make a backward incompatible change, it’s best to do it gradually.
